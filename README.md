# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and some extra commands in `package.json` to make it super easy to deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Commands to Note

### `npm dev`

This is for use when developing the website locally, runs a live deployment of the React App while also compiliing SASS code in real-time.

### `npm deploy`

This packages up the website and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch, usually goes live on the associated domain within just a couple minutes of running the command.

## Learn More
